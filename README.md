# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple console-based implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in C#. Cause why not!
## How to Play
1. The player chooses one of the options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The program randomly selects one of the options as the computer's choice.
3. The winner is determined based on the classic rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
4. Scores are updated after each round:
   - The player gets a point for winning.
   - The computer gets a point for winning.
   - Ties do not affect scores.
5. The game continues to play round after round until the player types `quit`.

## Features
- User input validation for correct choices.
- Randomized computer choice using the `Random` class.
- Score tracking for both the player and the computer.
- Continuous gameplay until the user chooses to quit.

## Key Concepts Used
- Random numbers for computer choice generation.
